```
msgServer = MessageServer.new
sms = SMSChannel.new
whatsapp = WhatsAppChannel.new
email = EmailChannel.new
msgServer.add_channel(sms)
msgServer.add_channel(whatsapp)
msgServer.add_channel(email)
puts '---------'
user = User.new('Ram', 'ram@gmail.com', 7889900112)
user.subscribe(sms)
user.subscribe(whatsapp)
puts '---------'
msg1 = msgServer.create_message('text/plain', 'Hi, this is Ram!', user)
msgServer.send_message(msg1, sms)

## There should have been another method here to create a broadcast message which doesnt require user info.
msg2 = msgServer.create_message('blob', 'Picture uploaded', user)
msgServer.broadcast(msg2)
puts '---------'
user.receive_message sms
puts '---------'
user.receive_message whatsapp
